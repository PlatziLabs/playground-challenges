The rockets production is going so well that plans to build version 2 of the **`Galaxy`** and the **`Odissey`** are on the table. The engineering build team agree want to test a couple of new configurations **`over created rockets before deliver the new versions`**.

For example, some of these configurations consider the use of a **`Double Nozzle`** and a **`Liquid Fuel engine`** in a **`Galaxy`** rocket, the same for the **`Odissey`**.

The team agree that some **`Prototypes`** from the existing rocket must be created and then work.

Application engineering team agree that they don't want to create new entities for each prototype, so they are thinking in a way to work instances of the existing rockets. Do you know something we can use?

## Implementation plan

1. Make the common `Product` implements the functionality for create a prototype based in the existing instances of it.
2. Complete the implementation of the **`Galaxy`** and **`Odissey`** Rockets, making both implement the common `Product` behavior.
3. Make sure instances from both rockets return correct prototypes in their `clone` functionality.
