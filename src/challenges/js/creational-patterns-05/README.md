Congratulations! The system implementation has been a success, the engineering team and you have done an amazing job!

Now itâ€™s time from a last requirement: **`A rockets creation history`**. The idea is to have a record of all the rockets that have been created in an ordered list, containing only the names of the rockets.

However, there is an additional condition to meet: the history must be the same across all the factories. **`This means that only one instance of the history should exist`**.

Do you have any ideas on how to implement this?

## Implementation plan

1. Make `HistoryLog` class implements single instance strategy.

## Code Example

```js
const rocketsCreationHistory = HistoryLog.getInstance();

rocketsCreationHistory.addEntry({ msg: 'Galaxy-Rocket-Creation' });
rocketsCreationHistory.addEntry({ msg: 'Odissey-Rocket-Creation' });
const history = newRocketsCreationHistory.history;
console.log(history); // ['Galaxy-Rocket-Creation','Odissey-Rocket-Creation']

const newRocketsCreationHistory = HistoryLog.getInstance();
const history = newRocketsCreationHistory.history;
console.log(history); // ['Galaxy-Rocket-Creation','Odissey-Rocket-Creation']
```
