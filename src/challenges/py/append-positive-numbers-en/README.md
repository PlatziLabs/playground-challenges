In this challenge, you will be provided with a list of numbers called `my_list`. Your task is to go through this list and use a loop to select only the positive numbers. Then, you must add these numbers to a new list called `new_list`. At the end of the loop, you must print the values contained in `new_list` using the `print` function.

For example, if the list is `[1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4]`, after performing the operations described above, the `new_list` should contain only the positive numbers, i.e. `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
