In this challenge, you have a variable called `number` as a string, your challenge is to determine if that string is an odd or even number. To do this validation, you must transform the string to number and then perform a conditional that checks if the number is divisible by two. If it is, it means that the number is even, and you must print the message `It is even`. If it is not, it means that the number is odd, and you should print the message `It is odd`.

Below are examples of how your solution should work:

Example 1:

```txt
Input: '2'
Output: "Is even"
```

Example 2:

````txt
Input: '3'
Output: "Is odd"
```

Remember to pay attention to the spaces and capitalization of the string as an answer, as they are important for your answer to be correct.
