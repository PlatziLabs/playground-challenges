In this challenge, you are going to practice what you have learned about variables in Python. A variable is a place in memory where you can store a value, for example, a number or a text string. In Python, variables are declared using the variable name, followed by an equal sign and the value you want to assign to the variable. For example:

```py
text = 'My text
print(text)
```

Remember that variables can be modified throughout a program, your challenge is to modify the value of the variable text to be a number and then print it using the print function.
