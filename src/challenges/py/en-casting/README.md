In this challenge, you will be provided with a code base where you will find the variables `name` and `age` all as strings. Your task is to create a string format that, as a result, displays a message in the **Terminal** section. The message should have the following form:

```txt
Hello my name is {name}, I am {age} years old and in 10 years I will be {total} years old.
```

Note that you must calculate how old you will be in 10 years from the age. For example, if the age is 29 years, the message displayed should say "I am 29 years old and in 10 years I will be 39 years old."

Here are some other examples:

Example 1:

```txt
Input:
name: 'John
age: '10

Output:
Hello my name is Juan, I am 10 years old and in 10 years I will be 20 years old.
```

Example 2:

````txt
Input:
name: Andrea
age: 22

Output:
Hello my name is Andreaasas, I am 22 years old and in 10 years I will be 32 years old.
```

Remember to pay attention to spaces and capital letters, as they are important for your answer to be correct.
